# Simulating patient-level HIV clinic visit data

**What this does:**
+ This script quickly generates two different patient-level HIV clinic datasets with a few key patient-level demographic attributes. This script does not draw from any probability distributions or data elements in actual HIV clinical datasets. 

**Original intent:**
+ This script was generated as part of a PEPFAR training exercise on utilizing individual-level patient data on HIV clinic visits. The purpose of the training was to expose participants to individual-level clinical datasets as opposed to the MER aggregate data.


**Potential future activities:**
1) Develop more complex and realistic probability distributions for demographic data that more closely match PEPFAR patient populations
2) Add in biophysical attributes (weight, bp, height) that realistically vary over time within different patient subgroups (e.g. realistic weight increases for infants)
